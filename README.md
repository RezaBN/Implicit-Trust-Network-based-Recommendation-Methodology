# Implicit-Trust-Network-based-Recommendation-Methodology (ITNRM)

ITNRM is a recommendation methodology proposed by Reza Barzegar Nozari and Hamidreza Koohi. It was published in Expert Systems With Application and is available online: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115709

This version is a primary code of the ITNRM by MATLAB. In this version, a main code has been presented for each dataset of Filmtrust, Ciao, and MoviLens 100K and 1M.
A description of ITNRM is available from https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NlfoQvzhTNGuEgkIPM8Tfb90FFepkbYql1FQkc4dxCM/edit?usp=sharing
